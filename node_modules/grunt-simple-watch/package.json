In addition, the plugin should be listed in package.json as a `devDependency`, which ensures that it will be installed whenever the `npm install` command is run.\n\n[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/\n[Getting Started]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/devel/docs/getting_started.md\n[package.json]: https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html\n\n<h1>WHY?</h1>\nHaving all sort of weird issues with grunt watch?\n\nThis is because it currently uses an unstable node.js functionality - <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener\">fs.watch()</a>\n\n<h1>What happend on my case</h1>\nIm using grunt on a virtualbox dev server with Ubuntu 11.10 and Node 0.6.19.\nMy host system is Windows 7. \n\nMy project files are on a shared folder between the host and server\nWhen i update files on the shared folder it does not trigger the fs.watch \n\n<h1>The solution</h1>\nDO NOT USE fs.watch\n\nbut solve it simply by polling for changes in the most basic/simple way.\n\nThis might be more CPU intensive, and might not work in high loads with many watched files.\nBut im not sure if the original watch task would do the job as well on this case. i just did not check.\n\n<h1>Getting Started</h1>\nInstall this grunt plugin next to your project's [grunt.js gruntfile][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-`\n\nThen add this line to your project's `grunt.js` gruntfile:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-simple-watch');\n```\n\n[grunt]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt\n[getting_started]: https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md\n\n(or simple place the task file simple_watch.js in your grunt/tasks directory..)\n\nuse the command: <b>grunt simple-watch<b> (instead of: grunt watch)\n\n<b>NO NEED TO CHANGE grunt.js configurations</b> (your gruntfile)!\n\nas it keeps on using the \"watch\" config.\n\n--\n\nDeveloped at SupersonicAds R&D labs.\n\n<h1>License</h1>\nCopyright (c) 2012 Amir Souchami \nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
